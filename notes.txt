Some notes on what needs to be done for pmfs

(DONE for now) Append to File
Copy File (do this at the block level really - and between file systems potentially - it's really a series of append file calls for each block)
Create file of a given type (which can also be used to create a mountable file)
Handling traversal of mounted filesystems
Upper side caching of nodes, channel to sync updates, non-removal of cached items that are not synced
Series files (pass inode and key/value to underlying)
Tags (filesystem based tagname -> key/value (and path or inode?), with the ability to search, order, filter etc.)
    e.g.   Color -> Red -> [ /one/two, /three/four]
    Find paths where color = 'Red'
    Updating tags on deletion (so perhaps a reverse index needs to also be stored)
    Tag data saved as nodes of course
Versioning
    Create new version instead of just overwriting. Version links could be perhaps tags pointing to inodes of the original file node
     instead of paths
    E.g.    Version -> /one/two/three [ 1 -> 12223, 2 -> 22211, 3 -> 23324 ]
Functions to page through a file or directory listing (byte point to byte point, series start to end, etc.)
MongoDB implementation
Cassandra implementation
Postgresql implementation
(INPROGRESS) Client side shell https://github.com/nsf/termbox-go
Thrift api + client side application (using that console based library?) (like a shell prompt with some screen stuff going on)
Web front end (browse structure, search using tags, browse versions, update data, append data, delete data, create mount points, archive versions)
Symbolic links (hard and soft)
Channel on shell to show output from filesystem execution (messages basically)


Sample commands through the "shell"

cd /alan   ; do a stat on the folder
ls         ; dir listing
cat /alan/1  ; print out contents
append /alan/1 content  ; add to file
append 1 content  ; add to file, using the current directory
rm 1    ; delete a file
copy 1 2  ; copy one file to another
stat 1  ; print out information on a file
mount /fred/mongo mongodb:/127.0.0.1:1222/db collectionName
append /fred/mongo/one Some content ; Would now be writing to mongodb
cat /fred/mongo ; Would write out some information about the mount point
rm /fred/mongo ; Would remove that mount point (maybe not removing the data?)

Some bugs

appending data goes into continuation continually once it starts
